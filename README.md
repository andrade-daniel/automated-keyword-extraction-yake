# Automated Keyword Extraction

An exercise to demonstrate the automated extraction of keywords from texts by using the great YAKE! package.

It's based on a Medium article, where another approach was taken (also valid, but wanted to test YAKE! that I highly recommend).

Both results can be compared (from link below and Jupyter notebook shared here).


### Installing YAKE!

At the command prompt:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/LIAAD/yake
```
